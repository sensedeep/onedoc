Model APIs take a params parameter that configures and controls the API execution. API errors will throw an instance of the OneTableError error class. See Error Handling for more details. create 1 async create(properties, params = {}) Create an item in the database. This API wraps the DynamoDB putItem method. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing all the required attributes for the item and must contain the required keys or fields that are used to create the primary key. OneTable will only write fields in properties that correspond to the schema attributes for the model. Superfluous property fields will be ignored. The property names are those described by the schema. NOTE: these are not the same as the attribute names stored in the Database. If a schema uses map to define a mapped attribute name, the Javascript field name and the DynamoDB attribute name may be different. The method returns the Javascript properties created for the item. Hidden attributes will not be returned. Before creating the item, all the properties will be validated according to any defined schema validations and all required properties will be checked. Similarly, properties that use a schema enum definition will be checked that their value is a valid enum value. Encrypted fields will be encrypted transparently before writing. For create, the params.exists will default to a false value to ensure an item of the same key does not already exist. If set to null, a create will be allowed to overwrite an existing item. Unique Fields If the schema specifies that an attribute must be unique, OneTable will create a special item in the database to enforce the uniqueness. This item will be an instance of the Unique model with the primary key set to _unique:Model:Attribute:Value . The created item and the unique item will be created in a transparent transaction so that the item will be created only if all the unique fields are truly unique. The remove API will similarly remove the special unique item. When a unique field for an item is updated, the prior item value must be read first so that the unique item can be deleted. If you do an update and do not specify params.return == 'NONE', the update API must return the full updated item. This incurs an additional get request to fetch the updated values as DynamoDB transactions do not return item values. There is thus additional I/O and overhead for unique items, so take care when designating attributes as unique in high update volume items. The optional params are described in Model API Params . find 1 async find(properties, params = {}) Find items in the database. This API wraps the DynamoDB query method. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing the required keys or fields that are used to determine the primary key or keys. The sort key may be defined as a simple value or as a key condition by setting the property to an object that defines the condition. The condition operator is specified as the key, and the operand as the value. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 let user = await User . find ({ pk , sk : { begins : 'user:john' }}) let tickets = await Ticket . find ({ pk , sk : { between : [ 1000 , 2000 ]}}) let invoices = await Invoice . find ({ pk , sk : { '<=' : 1000 }}) let invoices = await Invoice . find ({ pk }, { where : '${sk} <= {1000}' }) let items = await Invoice . find ({ pk }, { where : '${sk} <= {1000}' }, { count : true }) let count = items . count The operators include: 1 2 3 < <= = >= > begins or begins_with between Additional fields supplied in properties are used to construct a filter expression which is applied by DynamoDB after reading the data but before returning it to the caller. OneTable will utilize fields in properties that correspond to the schema attributes for the model. Superfluous property fields will be ignored in the filter expression. More complex filter expressions may be created via a params.where property. For example: 1 2 3 let adminUsers = await User . find ({}, { where : '(${role} = {admin}) and (${status} = {current})' }) Use params.count set to true to return the number of matching items instead of returning the items. See Where Clause for more details. If find is called without a sort key on a model that has a sort key value template, OneTable will synthesize a sort key value using the leading portion of the sort key value template. For example, if the sort key is defined as: 1 2 3 Card : { sk : { type : String , value : 'card:${id}' } } then, OneTable will use a begins_with card: key condition expression. This will also work if you use ${_type} as the leading prefix. Without the ingredient properties needed calculate the sort key from its value template, find will synthesize a sort key using the leading portion utilize the model type as a sort key prefix and return all matching model items. This can be used to fetch all items that match the primary hash key and are of the specified model type. The find method returns an array of items after applying any schema mappings. Hidden attributes in items will not be returned. Pagination The find method will automatically invoke DynamoDB query to fetch additional items and aggregate the result up to the limit specified by params.limit . If the limit is exceeded, the last key fetched is set in the 'result.next' property of the returned array of items. You can provide this as params.next to a subsequent API call to continue the query with the next page of results. 1 2 3 4 5 6 let next do { let items = await User . find ({ accountId }, { limit : 10 , next }) // process items next = items . next } while ( next ) To scan backwards, set Params.reverse to true. The keys for the first item are returned in params.prev which can be used to retrieve the previous page. 1 2 3 let firstPage = await User . find ({ accountId }, { limit }) let secondPage = await User . find ({ accountId }, { limit , next : secondPage.next }) let previousPage = await User . find ({ accountId }, { limit , prev : items.prev }) Note: the limit is the number of items read by DynamoDB before filtering and thus may not be equal to the number of items returned if you are using filtering expressions. The optional params are fully described in Model API Params . Some relevant params include: If params.execute is set to false, the command will not be executed and the prepared DynamoDB API parameters will be returned. The params.fields may be set to a list of properties to return. This defines the ProjectionExpression. If the params.follow is set to true, each item will be re-fetched using the returned results. This is useful for KEYS_ONLY secondary indexes where OneTable will use the retrieved keys to fetch all the attributes of the entire item using the primary index. This incurs an additional request for each item, but for large data sets, it enables the transparent use of a KEYS_ONLY secondary index which may greatly reduce the size (and cost) of the secondary index. The params.limit specifies the maximum number of items for DynamoDB to read. The params.next defines the start point for the returned items. It is typically set to the last key returned from previous invocation via the result.next property. Note: the limit is the number of items DynamoDB reads before filtering. The params.maxPages specifies the maximum number of DynamoDB query requests that OneTable will perform for a single API request. When doing a find or query with a filter expression, DynamoDB may scan up to 1MB and may return no items. Find will re-issue the API following the next key to retrieve the set of results. A maxPages limit will define the maximum number of times Find will query DynamoDB for another chunk of results. If params.parse is set to false, the unmodified DynamoDB response will be returned. Otherwise the results will be parsed and mapped into a set of Javascript properties. If params.next or params.prev is set to a map that contains the primary hash and sort key values for an existing item, the query will commence at that item. The params.next will be the exclusive start of the query, whereas params.prev will define the end of the query. These two properties are mutually exclusive, both of them can't be set at the same time. The params.where clause may be used to augment the filter expression. This will define a FilterExpression and the ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues. See Where Clause for more details. get 1 async get(properties, params = {}) Get an item from the database. This API wraps the DynamoDB getItem method. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing the required keys or fields that are used to create the primary key. Additional fields supplied in properties may be used to construct a filter expression. In this case, a find query is first executed to identify the item to retrieve. Superfluous property fields will be ignored. The get method returns Javascript properties for the item after applying any schema mappings. Hidden attributes will not be returned. The optional params are fully described in Model API Params . Some relevant params include: The params.fields may be set to a list of properties to return. This defines the ProjectionExpression. If the params.follow is set to true, the item will be re-fetched using the retrieved keys for the item. This is useful for KEYS_ONLY secondary indexes where OneTable will use the retrieved keys to fetch all the attributes of the item using the primary index. This incurs an additional request, but for very large data sets, it enables the transparent use of a KEYS_ONLY secondary index which reduces the size of the database. If params.execute is set to false, the command will not be executed and the prepared DynamoDB API parameters will be returned. If params.parse is set to false, the unmodified DynamoDB response will be returned. Otherwise the results will be parsed and mapped into a set of Javascript properties. The params.where clause may be used to define a filter expression. This will define a FilterExpression and the ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues. See Where Clause for more details. init 1 async init(properties, params = {}) Return a constructed model item without writing to the database. This will return an object with all the model properties set to null including default properties, UUID properties and value template properties. Be careful using these objects with create() as you should define values for all attributes. remove 1 async remove(properties, params = {}) Remove an item from the database. This wraps the DynamoDB deleteItem method. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing the required keys or fields that are used to create the primary key. Additional fields supplied in properties may be used to construct a filter expression. In this case, a find query is first executed to identify the item to remove. Superfluous property fields will be ignored. The optional params are fully described in Model API Params . Some relevant params include: The params.fields may be set to a list of properties to return. This defines the ProjectionExpression. If params.execute is set to false, the command will not be executed and the prepared DynamoDB API parameters will be returned. If params.many is set to true, the API may be used to delete more than one item. Otherwise, for safety, it is assume the API will only remove one item. The params.where clause may be used to define a filter expression. This will define a FilterExpression and the ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues. See Where Clause for more details. This API does not return a result. To test if the item was actually removed, set params.exists to true and the API will throw an exception if the item does not exist. scan 1 async scan(properties, params = {}) Scan items in the database and return items of the given model type. This wraps the DynamoDB scan method and uses a filter expression to extract the designated model type. Use scanItems to return all model types. NOTE: this will still scan the entire database. An alternative to using scan to retrieve all items of a give model type is to create a GSI and index the model type field and then use query to retrieve the items. This index can be a sparse index if only a subset of models are indexed. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing fields used to construct a filter expression which is applied by DynamoDB after reading the data but before returning it to the caller. OneTable will utilize fields in properties that correspond to the schema attributes for the model. Superfluous property fields will be ignored in the filter expression. The scan method returns an array of items after applying any schema mappings. Hidden attributes in items will not be returned. The optional params are fully described in Model API Params .

The params.where clause may be used to augment the filter expression. This will define a FilterExpression and the ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues. See Where Clause for more details. The scan method supports parallel scan where you invoke scan simultaneously from multiple workers. Using the async/await pattern, you can start the workers and then use a Promise.all to wait for their completion. To perform parallel scans, you should set the params.segments to the number of parallel segements and the params.segment to the numeric segment to be scaned for that worker. 1 2 3 4 5 6 const segments = 4 let promises = [] for (let segment = 0; segment < segments; segment++) { promises.push(table.scan({}, {segment, segments})) } let results = await Promise.all(promises) template 1 async template(fieldName, properties) Return the evaluated field value template based on the given properties. This is a utility routine to manually evaluate value templates. update 1 async update(properties, params = {}) Update an item in the database. This method wraps the DynamoDB updateItem API. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing properties to update including the required keys or fields that are used to create the primary key. OneTable will only update fields in properties that correspond to the schema attributes for the model. Superfluous property fields will be ignored. The property names are those described by the schema. NOTE: these are not the same as the attribute names stored in the Database. If a schema uses map to define a mapped attribute name, the Javascript field name and the DynamoDB attribute name may be different. The method returns the all the Javascript properties for the item. Hidden attributes will not be returned. If the method fails to update, it will throw an exception. If params.throw is set to false, an exception will not be thrown and the method will return undefined . The optional params are described in Model API Params . The params.add parameter may be set a value to add to property. The params.delete parameter may be set to a hash, where the hash keys are the property sets to modify and the values are the items in the sets to remove. The params.remove parameter may be set to a list of properties to remove. The params.set parameter may be set to a hash, where the hash keys are the properties to modify and the values are expresions. The propertys provided to params.add, delete, remove and set are property names (not mapped attribute names). If a property is specified in the API properties first argument and the property is also set in params.set, params.delete, params.remove or params.add, then the params.* property value takes precedence. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 await User . update ({ id : userId }, { delete : { tokens : [ 'captain' ]}}) await User . update ({ id : userId }, { remove : [ 'special' , 'suspended' ]}) await User . update ({ id : userId }, { set : { balance : '${balance} + {100}' }}) await User . update ({ id : userId }, { set : { contacts : 'list_append(if_not_exists(${contacts}, @{empty_list}), @{newContacts})' }, substitutions : { newContacts : [ '+15555555555' ], empty_list : []} }) In update, the params.exists will default to a true value to ensure the item exists. If set to null, an update will be permitted to create an item if it does not already exist. This implements an \"upsert\" operation. In this case, you must provide values for all properties that are required for a create.","title":"Methods"},{"location":"api/model/methods/#create","text":"1 async create(properties, params = {}) Create an item in the database.

This method wraps the DynamoDB updateItem API. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing properties to update including the required keys or fields that are used to create the primary key. OneTable will only update fields in properties that correspond to the schema attributes for the model. Superfluous property fields will be ignored. The property names are those described by the schema. NOTE: these are not the same as the attribute names stored in the Database. If a schema uses map to define a mapped attribute name, the Javascript field name and the DynamoDB attribute name may be different. The method returns the all the Javascript properties for the item. Hidden attributes will not be returned. If the method fails to update, it will throw an exception. If params.throw is set to false, an exception will not be thrown and the method will return undefined . The optional params are described in Model API Params . The params.add parameter may be set a value to add to property. The params.delete parameter may be set to a hash, where the hash keys are the property sets to modify and the values are the items in the sets to remove.

The params.set parameter may be set to a hash, where the hash keys are the properties to modify and the values are expresions. The propertys provided to params.add, delete, remove and set are property names (not mapped attribute names). If a property is specified in the API properties first argument and the property is also set in params.set, params.delete, params.remove or params.add, then the params.* property value takes precedence.

DynamoDB ExpressionAttributeNames and Values are one of the least fun parts of DynamoDB. OneTable makes this much easier via the use of templated where clauses to express complex filter expressions. A where clause may be used with find , scan , create , delete or update APIs to specify a Filter or Conditional update expression. OneTable will parse the where clause and extract the names and values to use with the DynamoDB API. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 let adminUsers = await User . find ({}, { where : '(${role} = {admin}) and (${status} = @{status})' , substitutions : { status : 'current' } }) OneTable will extract property names defined inside ${} braces, variable substitutions in @{} braces and values inside {} braces and will automatically define your filter or conditional expressions and the required ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues. If a value inside {} is a number, it will be typed as a number for DynamoDB. To force a value to be treated as a string, wrap it in quotes, for example: {\"42\"} . Note: the property name is an unmapped schema property name and not a mapped attribute name. Substitutions also support a splat syntax for use with filterExpressions and the IN operator. With this syntax, the list is expanded in-situ and each list item is defined as a separate ExpressionAttributeValue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 let adminUsers = await User . find ({}, { where : '(${role} IN @{...roles})' , substitutions : { roles : [ 'user' , 'admin' ] } }) Where Clause Operators You can use the following operators with a where clause: < <= = <> >= > AND OR NOT BETWEEN IN () attribute_exists() attribute_not_exists() attribute_type() begins_with() contains() not_contains() size Where clauses when used with find or scan on non-key attributes can also use the <> not equals operator.

This is useful for multi-tenant applications. When creating items, context properties are written to the database. When updating, context properties are not, only explicit attributes provided in the API properties parameter are written. Context properties take precedence over supplied properties . This is to prevent accidental updating of context keys. To force an update of context attributes, provide the context properties either by updating the context via Table.addContext , replacing the context via Table.setContext or supplying an explicit context via params.context to the individual API.

Returns a map indexed by index name or 'primary'. The partition key property is named 'hash' and the sort key 'sort'. getItem 1 async getItem(properties, params = {}) Get an item from the database. This API wraps the DynamoDB getItem method. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing the required keys or fields that are used to create the primary key. Additional fields supplied in properties may be used to construct a filter expression. In this case, a find query is first executed to identify the item to retrieve. Superfluous property fields will be ignored. The get method returns Javascript properties for the item after applying any schema mappings. Hidden attributes will not be returned. The optional params are fully described in Model API Params . Some relevant params include: The params.fields may be set to a list of properties to return. This defines the ProjectionExpression. If params.execute is set to false, the command will not be executed and the prepared DynamoDB API parameters will be returned. If params.parse is set to true, the results will be parsed and mapped into a set of Javascript properties. By default, the unmodified DynamoDB results are returned. The params.where clause may be used to define a filter expression. This will define a FilterExpression and the ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues. See Where Clause for more details. getModel 1 getModel(name) Return a model for the given model name. groupByType 1 groupByType(items) Return the items grouped by the configured table typeField property. Returns a map indexed by type name. listModels 1 listModels() Return a list of models defined on the Table . listTables 1 async listTables() Return a list of tables in the database. putItem 1 async putItem(properties, params = {}) Create an item in the database. This API wraps the DynamoDB putItem method. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing all the required attributes for the item and must contain the required keys or fields that are used to create the primary key. OneTable will only write fields in properties that correspond to the schema attributes for the model. Superfluous property fields will be ignored. The property names are those described by the schema. NOTE: these are not the same as the attribute names stored in the Database. If a schema uses map to define a mapped attribute name, the Javascript field name and the DynamoDB attribute name may be different. The method returns the unmodified DynamoDB put response. If params.parse is set to true, it will return the Javascript properties created for the item with hidden attributes will not be returned. Before creating the item, all the properties will be validated according to any defined schema validations and all required properties will be checked. Similarly, properties that use a schema enum definition will be checked that their value is a valid enum value. Encrypted fields will be encrypted transparently before writing. The params.fields may be set to a list of properties to return. This defines the ProjectionExpression. If params.execute is set to false, the command will not be executed and the prepared DynamoDB API parameters will be returned. If params.parse is set to true, the results will be parsed and mapped into a set of Javascript properties. Otherwise, the unmodified DynamoDB response will be returned. queryItems 1 async queryItems(properties, params) This API invokes the DynamoDB query API and return the results. The properties should include the relevant key properties. The sort key may be defined as a key condition by setting the property to an object that defines the condition. The condition operator is specified as the key, and the operand as the value. These operators may only be used with the sort key property. If the sort key uses a value template, you cannot use the operator on the sort key value directly and not on the properties that are referenced in the value template. For example: 1 2 3 let user = await table . queryItems ({ pk , sk : { begins : 'user:john' }}) let tickets = await table . queryItems ({ pk , sk : { between : [ 1000 , 2000 ]}}) let invoices = await table . queryItems ({ pk , sk : { '<=' : 1000 }}) The operators include: 1 2 3 < <= = <> >= > begins or begins_with between Filter Expressions Non-key fields are used to construct a filter expression which is applied by DynamoDB after reading the data but before returning it to the caller. OneTable will utilize fields in properties that correspond to the schema attributes for the model. Superfluous property fields will be ignored in the filter expression. More complex filter expressions may be created via a params.where property. For example: 1 let invoices = await table . queryItems ({ pk }, { where : '${sk} <= {1000}' }) See Where Clause for more details. If queryItems is called without a sort key, queryItems will utilize the model type as a sort key prefix and return all matching model items. This can be used to fetch all items that match the primary hash key and are of the specified model type. The queryItems method returns an array of items after applying any schema mappings. Hidden attributes in items will not be returned. Some useful params for queryItems include: The params.index may be set to the desired index name. The params.where clause may be used to define a filter expression. This will define a FilterExpression and the ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues. See Where Clause for more details. The params.fields may be set to a list of properties to return. This defines the ProjectionExpression. If params.execute is set to false, the command will not be executed and the prepared DynamoDB API parameters will be returned. If params.parse is set to true, the results will be parsed and mapped into a set of Javascript properties. Otherwise, the unmodified DynamoDB response will be returned. readSchema 1 async readSchema(): OneSchema Read the Current schema from the table if it has been stored there via saveSchema . readSchemas 1 async readSchemas(): OneSchema[] Read all stored schemas from the table. remove 1 async remove(modelName, properties, params = {}) Delete an item in the database of the given model modelName as defined in the table schema. Wraps the Model.remove API. See Model.remove for details. removeModel 1 removeModel(name) Remove a model from the current schema in use by the table. This does not impact the persisted schemas. removeSchema 1 removeSchema(schema) Remove a schema from the persisted Table schema items. The schema should include a name property that describes the schema. saveSchema 1 async saveSchema(schema?: OneSchema): OneSchema Save the current schema to the table using the _Schema:_Schema hash/sort key pair. If the schema parameter is null or not provided, the currently configured schema will be saved. If a schema is provided and the schema.params is unset, the saved schema will include the current Table parms. scanItems 1 async scanItems(params) Invokes the DynamoDB scan API and return the results. Some relevant params include: The params.where clause may be used to define a filter expression. This will define a FilterExpression and the ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues. See Where Clause for more details. The params.fields may be set to a list of properties to return. This defines the ProjectionExpression. If params.execute is set to false, the command will not be executed and the prepared DynamoDB API parameters will be returned. If params.parse is set to true, the results will be parsed and mapped into a set of Javascript properties. Otherwise, the unmodified DynamoDB response will be returned. The scan method supports parallel scan where you invoke scan simultaneously from multiple workers. Using the async/await pattern, you can start the workers and then use a Promise.all to wait for their completion. To perform parallel scans, you should set the params.segments to the number of parallel segements and the params.segment to the numeric segment to be scaned for that worker. 1 2 3 4 5 6 const segments = 4 let promises = [] for (let segment = 0; segment < segments; segment++) { promises.push(table.scanItems({}, {segment, segments})) } let results = await Promise.all(promises) setClient 1 setClient(client) Assign an AWS SDK V2 DocumentClient or AWS SDK V3 Dynamo helper client to be used for communiction with DynamoDB. Note the V3 DocumentClient instance is a native AWS SDK DocumentClient instance. For AWS SDK V3, the client is an instance of the OneTable Dynamo helper. setContext 1 setContext(context = {}, merge = false) Set the table context properties. If merge is true, the properties are blended with the existing context. setSchema 1 async setSchema(schema?: OneSchema) Set the current schema for the table instance. This will reset the current schema. If the schema parameter contains a schema.params, these will be applied and overwrite the current Table params. If the schema property is null, the current schema will be removed. transact 1 async transact(operation, transaction, params = {}) Invoke a prepared transaction and return the results. Transactions are prepared by creating a bare transaction object {} and passing that via params.transaction to the various OneTable APIs to build up a transactional operation. Finally invoking transact will execute the accumulated API calls within a DynamoDB transaction. The operation parameter should be set to write or get . The transaction parameter should initially be set to {} and then be passed to API calls via params.transaction . A get operation will return an array containing the items retrieved. The Table.groupBy can be used to organize the returned items by model. E.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 let transaction = {} await table . get ( 'Account' , { id : accountId }, { transaction }) await table . get ( 'User' , { id : userId }, { transaction }) let items = await table . transact ( 'get' , transaction , { parse : true , hidden : true }) items = table . groupByType ( items ) let accounts = items . Account let users = items . User update 1 async update(modelName, properties, params = {}) Update an item in the database of the given model modelName as defined in the table schema. Wraps the Model.update API. See Model.update for details. updateItem 1 async updateItem(properties, params) Update an item in the database. This method wraps the DynamoDB updateItem API. The properties parameter is a Javascript hash containing properties to update including the required keys or fields that are used to create the primary key. OneTable will only update fields in properties that correspond to the schema attributes for the model. Superfluous property fields will be ignored. The property names are those described by the schema. NOTE: these are not the same as the attribute names stored in the Database. If a schema uses map to define a mapped attribute name, the Javascript field name and the DynamoDB attribute name may be different. The method returns the unmodified DynamoDB response. If params.parse is true, the call returns the Javascript properties for the item with hidden attributes removed. The optional params are described in Model API Params . The params.fields may be set to a list of properties to return. This defines the ProjectionExpression. If params.execute is set to false, the command will not be executed and the prepared DynamoDB API parameters will be returned. If params.parse is set to true, the results will be parsed and mapped into a set of Javascript properties. Otherwise, the unmodified DynamoDB response will be returned. updateTable 1 async updateTable(params) Update a table and create or remove a Global Secondary Index. Set params.create to an index to create. Set create to a map with properties for the hash and sort attributes. E.g. 1 2 3 4 5 await table . updateTable ({ create : { hash : 'gs1pk' , hash : 'gs2pk' , name : 'gs1' , }}) Set params.remove to remove an index. Set remove to a map with a name property of the table to remove.

Attributes with a \"value\" template defined will by hidden by default. Default to the schema params value. isoDates boolean Set to true to store dates as Javascript ISO strings vs epoch numerics. If unset, the field will use the table default value for isoDates. Default to the schema params value. map string Map the field value to a different attribute name when storing in the database. Can be a simple attribute name or a compound \"obj.name\" where multiple fields can be stored in a single attribute containing an object with all the fields. nulls boolean Set to true to store null values or false to remove attributes set to null. Default false. required boolean Set to true if the attribute is required. Default to the schema params value. reference string Describes a reference to another entity item. Format is: model:index:attribute=src-attribute,... schema object Nested schema. ttl boolean Set to true to store the date value as a Unix epoch in seconds suitable for use as a DynamoDB TTL attribute. type Type or string Type to use for the attribute. unique boolean Set to true to enforce uniqueness for this attribute. Default false. validate RegExp Regular expression to use to validate data before writing. value string Template to derive the value of the attribute. These attributes are \"hidden\" by default. If the default property defines the default value for an attribute. If no value is provided for the attribute when creating a new item, the default value will be used. If the hidden property is set to true, the attribute will be defined in the DynamoDB database table, but will be omitted in the returned Javascript results. If the isoDates property is defined and not-null, it will override the table isoDates value. Set to true to store the field date value as an ISO date string. Set to false to store the date as a Unix epoch date number. The map property can be used to set an alternate or shorter attribute name when storing in the database. The map value may be a simple string that will be used as the actual attribute name. Alternatively, the map value can be a pair of the form: 'obj.name', where the attribute value will be stored in an object attribute named \"obj\" with the given name name . Such two-level mappings may be used to map multiple properties to a single table attribute. This is helpful for the design pattern where GSIs project keys plus a single 'data' field and have multiple models map relevant attributes into the projected 'data' attribute. OneTable will automatically pack and unpack attribute values into the mapped attribute. Note: APIs that write to a mapped attribute must provide all the properties that map to that attribute on the API call. Otherwise an incomplete attribute would be written to the table. The reference attribute documents a reference to another entity by using this attribute in combination with other attributes. The format is: 1 model:index:attribute = source-attribute,... The \"model\" selects that target entity model of the reference using the nominated \"index\" where the target \"attribute\" is determined by the associated source-attribute. Multiple attributes can be specified. Tools can use this reference to navigate from one entity item to another. The schema property permits nested field definitions. The parent property must be an Object as Arrays are not yet supported. Note: TypeScript typings are not created for nested schemas. The ttl property supports DynamoDB TTL expiry attributes. Set to true to store a supplied date value as a Unix epoch in seconds suitable for use as a DynamoDB TTL attribute. The type properties defines the attribute data type. Valid types include: String, Number, Boolean, Date, Object, Null, Array, Buffer (or Binary) and Set. The object type is mapped to a map , the array type is mapped to a list . Dates are stored as Unix numeric epoch date stamps unless the isoDates parameter is true, in which case the dates are store as ISO date strings. Binary data is supplied via buffer types and is stored as base64 strings in DynamoDB. The validate property defines a regular expression that is used to validate data before writing to the database. Highly recommended. The value property defines a literal string template that is used to compute the attribute value. This is useful for computing key values from other properties, creating compound (composite) sort keys or for packing fields into a single DynamoDB attribute when using GSIs. String templates are similar to JavaScript string templates. The template string may contain ${name} references to other fields defined in the entity model. If any of the variable references are undefined when an API is called, the computed field value will be undefined and the attribute will be omitted from the operation. The variable name may be of the form: ${name:size:pad} where the name will be padded to the specified size using the given pad character (which default to '0'). This is useful for zero padding numbers so that they sort numerically. If you call find or any query API and do not provide all the properties needed to resolve the complete value template. i.e. some of the ${var} references are unresolved, OneTable will take the resolved leading portion and create a begins with key condition for that portion of the value template.","title":"Model Attributes"},{"location":"api/table/schemas/indexes/","text":"The schema.indexes property can contain one or more indexes and must contain the primary key. Additional indexes will be treated as Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) unless they are defined with a type: \"local\" property in which case they will be designated as Local Secondary Indexes (LSIs).

The project property can be set to 'all' to project all attributes to the secondary index, set to 'keys' to project only keys and may be set to an array of attributes (not properties) to specify an explicit list of attributes to project. The project property is used by the Table.createTable and updateTable APIs only. The follow property is used to support GSI indexes that project KEYS_ONLY or only a subset of an items properties. When follow is true, any fetch of an item via the GSI will be transparently followed by a fetch of the full item using the primary index and the GSI projected keys. This incurs an additional request for each item, but for large data sets, it is useful to minimize the size of a GSI and yet retain access to full items.","title":"Indexes"},{"location":"api/table/schemas/modeling/","text":"OneTable models your application entities via a OneTable schema.

The version string is used by tools and consumers of the schema to understand compatibility constraints for the schema and stored data.

For each model, all the entity attributes are defined by specifying the attribute type, validations and other operational characteristics (uniqueness, IDs and templates). The valid types are: Array, Binary, Boolean, Buffer, Date, Number, Object, Set and String. OneTable will ensure that values are of the correct type before writing to the database. Where possible, values will be cast to their correct types. For example: 'false' will be cast to false for Boolean types and 1000 will be cast to '1000' for String types. These JavaScript types map onto the equivalent DynamoDB types. For Binary types, you can supply data values with the types: ArrayBuffer and Buffer. For Sets, you should set the schema type to Set and supply values as instances of the JavaScript Set type. DynamoDB supports sets with elements that are strings, numbers or binary data. OneTable will automatically add a _type attribute to each model that is set to the name of the model. However, you can explicitly define your type attribute in your model schema if you wish. The type field can be used in PK/SK value templates by using ${_type} . You can change the name of the type field from _type by setting the params.typeField in the Table constructor.

It provides a high-level, elegant dry syntax while still enabling full access to DynamoDB API. OneTable works with AWS V2 and V3 SDKs for JavaScript and TypeScript. For TypeScript, OneTable will create fully typed entities from your data schemas automatically. To see OneTable in action, take this quick tour of OneTable which demonstrates importing, configuring and basic operation of OneTable. Import OneTable To start, import the OneTable library. 1 import { Table } from 'dynamodb-onetable' Import the AWS SDK If you are not using ES modules or TypeScript, use require to import the libraries. If you are using the AWS SDK V2, import the AWS DynamoDB class and create a DocumentClient instance. 1 2 import DynamoDB from 'aws-sdk/clients/dynamodb' const client = new DynamoDB . DocumentClient ( params ) If you are using the AWS SDK V3, import the AWS V3 DynamoDBClient class and the OneTable Dynamo helper. Then create a DynamoDBClient instance and Dynamo wrapper instance. Note: you will need Node v14 or later for this to work. Note: you can use the Table.setClient API to defer setting the client or replace the client at any time. 1 2 3 4 import Dynamo from 'dynamodb-onetable/Dynamo' import { Model , Table } from 'dynamodb-onetable' import { DynamoDBClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb' const client = new Dynamo ({ client : new DynamoDBClient ( params )}) Configure the Table Class Initialize your OneTable Table instance and define your application entities via a OneTable schema. 1 2 3 4 5 const table = new Table ({ client : client , name : 'MyTable' , schema : MySchema , }) Data Modeling OneTable models your application entities via a OneTable schema. The schema defines your entities and their attributes and how they will be stored in your DynamoDB table. The schema also defines the table indexes. Here is a sample schema: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 const MySchema = { format : 'onetable:1.1.0' , version : '0.0.1' , indexes : { primary : { hash : 'pk' , sort : 'sk' }, gs1 : { hash : 'gs1pk' , sort : 'gs1sk' , follow : true }, ls1 : { sort : 'id' , type : 'local' }, }, models : { Account : { pk : { type : String , value : 'account:${id}' }, sk : { type : String , value : 'account:' }, id : { type : String , generate : 'ulid' , validate : /^[0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ]{26}$/i }, name : { type : String , required : true }, status : { type : String , default : 'active' }, zip : { type : String }, }, User : { pk : { type : String , value : 'account:${accountName}' }, sk : { type : String , value : 'user:${email}' , validate : EmailRegExp }, id : { type : String , required : true }, accountName : { type : String , required : true }, email : { type : String , required : true }, firstName : { type : String , required : true }, lastName : { type : String , required : true }, username : { type : String , required : true }, role : { type : String , enum : [ 'user' , 'admin' ], required : true , default : 'user' }, balance : { type : Number , default : 0 }, gs1pk : { type : String , value : 'user-email:${email}' }, gs1sk : { type : String , value : 'user:' }, } }, params : { 'isoDates' : true , 'timestamps' : true , }, } For each model, you define the entity attributes and their type and other properties.

Using the magic of TypeScript dynamic typing, OneTable automatically converts your OneTable schema into fully typed generic Model APIs. This way, OneTable creates type declarations for your table entities and attributes so that TypeScript will catch any invalid entity or entity attribute references. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 import { Entity , Model , Table } from 'dynamodb-onetable' const MySchema = { ... models : { Account : { pk : { type : String , value : 'account:${name}' }, name : { type : String }, } } as const // Required for TypeScript } When defining your OneTable schema for Typescript, you must use type objects (String, Date, Number etc) as the value for your type properties. When using Javascript, you can also use string values ('string', 'date', 'number'), but for Typescript, this will prevent the Typescript dynamic typing from working. You also need to append the as const to the end of your models in the schema.

Folks migrating from SQL often have a hard time adjusting to the NoSQL paradigm and especially to DynamoDB which offers exceptional scalability but with a fairly low-level API. The standard DynamoDB API requires a lot of boiler-plate syntax and expressions. This is tedious to use and can unfortunately can be error prone at times. I doubt that creating complex attribute type, key, filter, condition and update expressions are anyone's idea of a good time. Net/Net: it is not easy to write terse, clear, robust Dynamo code for one-table patterns. Our goal with OneTable for DynamoDB was to keep all the good parts of DynamoDB and to remove the tedium and provide a more natural, \"JavaScripty / TypeScripty\" way to interact with DynamoDB without obscuring any of the power of DynamoDB itself. For single-table designs, OneTable makes the job of managing single-table patterns a joy. OneTable easily manages multiple application entities, data integrity, compound keys, secondary indexes, validations and unique attributes.
